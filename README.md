A weather dashboard application that gathers information from the 'OpenWeatherMap' API, utilizing it's current and 5day forecast APIs. 

When a city is searched, the application displays the current temperature, humidity, and wind speed - and displays the temperature and humidity for the next five days. 

Utilized a new API for CSS as well, Materialize, to practice for the project.
